# LCG-in-ASP

The continuation of ASPReach

This program is aimed to solve the problem of big AND gates(say more than 5), which used to lead to heavy computation. To avoid global searching, this ASP-based approach gives possible firing order of local states in a simple AND gate, which permits the reachability of conjoint transition.
