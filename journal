    - Benchmark
05/04/2018 43 days
- Test finished, my approach takes more time in TCR but less time in EGFR than Pint, looking for the reason
- Find more application
    - Used Hyclock model and observations, but no interesting idea,
    - Go to read Loic and Maxime's paper for more possible applications
- Considering the collaboration asynchronous LFIT
    - The rules are not real rules as in synchronous Boolean network(Boolean function), they are just a simplification of observation, no "learning"
    - Rough idea for deleting or specifying rules(Create rules with new heads which never appear before)
    - Rough idea for adding rules (need more reachability information to decrease the complexity of LCG)
